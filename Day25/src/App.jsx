        1. Introduction to Performance Optimization: Write a short explanation
        of why performance optimization is important in React applications.{" "}
      </h2>
      <p>
        Performance optimization is crucial in React applications because it
        ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, especially in large or
        complex apps. Without optimization, frequent or unnecessary re-renders
        can slow down the UI, increase load times, and cause lag during
        interactions. By applying techniques like memoization, code splitting,
        and lazy loading, developers can reduce computational overhead, improve
        app speed, and enhance overall usabilityâ€”leading to better user
        satisfaction and lower resource usage.
